# AutoAstroGuia
Software for the auto-astroguide project.

You need a raspberry pi with bluetooth. A green (astronomical) laser, a led, a relee, two servos (ALT/AZM).

The *run.py* script executes everything. The device connects to the mobile phone and gets the GPS coordinates.

The device recieves commands from the mobile phone through bluetooth and points the laser towards the desired astronomical object.

The catalog contains more than 4000 deep-sky objects and more than 200000 stars.
